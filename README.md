# Life

Life is an implementation of the classical programming problem, [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), invented by a British mathematician called John H. Conway in 1970. This project is authored by [Mthabisi](https://github.com/codymndlovu) and [CÃ©dric](https://github.com/CedricMurairi) as our final project for the Programming 1 course at the African Leadership University.
